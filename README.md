# Diskai: A Discord theme for Monokai lovers

Isn’t Monokai just a wonderful colour scheme? Let’s make a Discord theme around it!

Main development target will be Powercord because BetterDiscord is broken on canary at the moment (2021-01-30).

I may add support for BBD if I get around to it.



# Hey theme devs! Listen!

The hypesquad banner in settings are annoying cause you can only get the class for the house you’re in. As of 2021-01-30, 16:57 GMT, ON DISCORD CANARY:

- `.membershipDialogHouse1-3KhKE-` is the Bravery class
- `.membershipDialogHouse2-35h9SY` is the Brilliance class
- `.membershipDialogHouse3-15OBIQ` is the Balance class
